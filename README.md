# Automatic Fire Extinguisher System

## Overview
The Automatic Fire Extinguisher System is designed to detect fire using a flame sensor interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller. When a flame is detected above a set threshold, the system activates a buzzer alarm and triggers a relay to control an extinguisher device. This system enhances safety by providing real-time fire detection and automated response suitable for residential or industrial applications.

## Working Principle
The flame sensor detects the presence of fire and sends an analog value to the Arduino. When the sensor value exceeds the threshold value, the Arduino activates the buzzer and relay. The relay can be further connected to a fire extinguisher mechanism for automatic response.
